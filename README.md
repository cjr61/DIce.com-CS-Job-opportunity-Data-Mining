# DIce.com-CS-Job-opportunity-Data-Mining

This Program takes a dataset from Dice.com that includes locations and job descriptions for Computer science opportunities.

The result is information on which skills (such as C#, Java, etc.) are needed in which locations allowing users to know where they can search for a job that best fits their skillset.
