# Data-Mining-Dice.com
This is the term project for Dr. CC Chan's Data Mining Class at the University of Akron.
Our program DiceMining.py takes in the csv file 'modifieddataset2.csv' and outputs a matrix of 
job locations and required skills at those locations. It is a rather large dataset so the program will
run for somewhere between 10-15 minutes depending on the machine. 

We used many different library functions such as NLTK and pandas so those libraries 
will need to be installed to run the program properly

The results of the transformed file can be seen in StatesTotals.xlsx
